Problem PM_MisalignedIndentation issued from inform7/Chapter 13/Rule Subtrees.w, line 414

  >--> The phrase or rule definition 'Check spinning it to' (source text, line 19)
    is written using the 'colon and indentation' syntax for its 'if's,
    'repeat's and 'while's, where blocks of phrases grouped together are
    indented one tab step inward from the 'if ...:' or similar phrase to which
    they belong. But the tabs here seem to be misaligned, and I can't determine
    the structure. The first phrase going awry in the definition seems to be
    'If the noun is not Genetics door and the noun is not Cybernetics door' (source
    text, line 20), in case that helps. This sometimes happens even when the
    code looks about right, to the eye, if rows of spaces have been used to
    indent phrases instead of tabs.
