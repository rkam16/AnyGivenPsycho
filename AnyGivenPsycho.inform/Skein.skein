Years of chasing the notorious criminal, Sum Ting Wong, has left you exhausted and on the verge of retiring your badge. But you have reaffirmed your resolve by remembering little Jamoca, a five year old girl who had her puppy, Lucky, flattened into a carpet by Wong&apos;s get away vehicle. Now you&apos;ve arrived in the slums of Callustine in hope that some clues in the criminal&apos;s home town may lead you to catching the scumbag.

Any Given Psycho
An Interactive Fiction by Riley Kam
Release 1 / Serial number 141023 / Inform 7 build 6L38 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Got Chu
Apparently this town has a weird sense of humor when it comes to naming their buildings. Outside of this dreary grocery store are some fruits and vegetables. A small wagon seems to be bringing in some new product. There are also some tents for an outrageous price outside the store. To the north is the community center.

Water Basin
 This lively part of the concrete jungle, teeming with a rich biodiversity consisting of construction workers and employees. Concrete has long filled in this once teeming riverbed, now all thats left are some exposed drainage pipes.

WOK INN
When it comes to play on words this old Chinese restaurant is a clear winner. Supposedly this place was Wong&apos;s favorite hang out but has clearly fallen out of grace. Dilapidated tables can barely hold the teacups, chopsticks and plates that rest on them. An old man sits in the corner with his head down, most likely the owner of this spit trap. The Water Basin is West.

You can see a freezer door here.

Then all of a sudden the whole restaurant shakes, bowls fall off the counters and the utensils fall to the floor. The old man in the corner remains the same, still and sleeping. As the quake comes to a halt you slowly regain your senses. Something about the room feels different...

Community Center
When push came to shove it seems like the community center didn&apos;t get the funds that it needed. It&apos;s really quite sad that this significant pillar in the community is no better than a trash collection center. There is a group of locals in the corner huddled around an old television. A small trashcan fire acts as the poor places heater. To the south is Got Chu. To the east is the Town Hall. 

The Trashcan Fire burns strongly in the room keeping this place warm. People also insert things into the fire to dispose of them.

When it comes to play on words this old Chinese restaurant is a clear winner. Supposedly this place was Wong&apos;s favorite hang out but has clearly fallen out of grace.

The (REC) in REC center is not supposed to be the adjective that describes the establishment. Inside of the building a broken barbell,  treadmill and leg press are clumped together. A full length mirror trends the northern wall of the gymnasium. There is a lone equipment cage with something stored inside. To the east is the water basin.

Community Center
When push came to shove it seems like the community center didn&apos;t get the funds that it needed. It&apos;s really quite sad that this significant pillar in the community is no better than a trash collection center. There is a group of locals in the corner huddled around an old television. A small trashcan fire acts as the poor places heater. To the south is Got Chu. To the east is the Town Hall. 

The Trashcan Fire burns strongly in the room keeping this place warm. People also insert things into the fire to dispose of them.

When it comes to play on words this old Chinese restaurant is a clear winner. Supposedly this place was Wong&apos;s favorite hang out but has clearly fallen out of grace. Dilapidated tables can barely hold the teacups, chopsticks and plates that rest on them. An old man sits in the corner with his head down, most likely the owner of this spit trap. The Water Basin is West.

You can see a freezer door here.

Community Center
When push came to shove it seems like the community center didn&apos;t get the funds that it needed. It&apos;s really quite sad that this significant pillar in the community is no better than a trash collection center. There is a group of locals in the corner huddled around an old television. A small trashcan fire acts as the poor places heater. To the south is Got Chu. To the east is the Town Hall. 

The Trashcan Fire burns strongly in the room keeping this place warm. People also insert things into the fire to dispose of them.

Town Hall
While marble pillars stand firm at the front of the states main building. . It would hold the impression of a civil war building if it weren&apos;t for the Chinese fireworks blatantly sticking out of the windows. Although its not open it seems as though a town official is waiting outside next to some crates. The Community center is west and the Water Basin is North. To the south is an Apartment complex with Wong&apos;s room.

Water Basin
 This lively part of the concrete jungle, teeming with a rich biodiversity consisting of construction workers and employees. Concrete has long filled in this once teeming riverbed, now all thats left are some exposed drainage pipes. Some of the areas still seem to be undone, one of which has a large blue tarp covering the exposed surface. To the west is the REC center, to the east is WOK INN, to the south is the Town Hall.

Hideout
When entering the dark passage you are blinded by an overwhelming light produced by 200 Gold Blocks. In the center of the room a map rest on top of a small graphing table. There is no sign of Wong but there is a human sized safe directly across from the entrance. The way back to WOK INN is to the west.

You can see a freezer door and a Safe (closed) here.
